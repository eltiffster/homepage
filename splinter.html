           <p>Then came the tiredness, thick and heavy, that coated my tongue and made my limbs feel like so much dead weight. In the beginning, it came and went: here and then gone in a day, here and then gone in a few days. Then the days dragged into weeks and the weeks dragged on until I couldn’t distinguish between the coming and the going because it was always there. Time expanded and warped. I felt as if I lived weeks in a matter of days and months in a matter of weeks, trapped in a state of exception or suspended animation.</p>

			<p>My appetite tended to evaporate as soon as it hit the plate. I hardly ate at all. My clothes loosened as I lost weight. My thoughts didn't so much flow as trickle, disjointed and feeble like drops from a leaky faucet.</p>

			<p>In December 2016, I saw a doctor. She diagnosed me with depression.</p>

			<p>I used to think that the difference between sadness and depression was a difference of severity rather than a difference of kind, but now I think that was misguided. Depression has its own unique flavour. It is a toxic cocktail of unrelenting loneliness, self-loathing, exhaustion, apathy, and despair.</p>
			<p>Many people asked me (as I asked myself)—why? I didn’t lose a job or a loved one. From the outside, by objective accounts, I was succeeding. For some, depression strikes during a catastrophic life event. But in my case, it struck when I thought I should have been happiest. I had a lighter workload than in the past. I lived in a nice part of town. Everything seemed fine, therefore everything <em>should</em> be fine. I couldn’t rationalize my emotions, and so my emotions coloured my reasoning.</p>
			<p>All of this led me to a false but devastating conclusion: the depression must somehow be my fault.</p>
			<p class="text-center">* * *</p>
			<p>At the time, I was in the second year of my Master’s in English. Academic culture had taught me to prize the mind above all else—to pin my identity to my intellect or, perhaps more accurately, my productivity. And because I was now (in my perception) so unproductive, depression felt like a particularly damning failure. A particularly poignant betrayal.</p> 
			<p>For personal reasons, not all of which were academic, I chose not to go on leave. In retrospect, I still stand my decision, although I now admit that I didn’t realize at the time exactly how much I was struggling. It is hard to know whether staying in school helped more than it hurt. On the one hand, the pressure and stress of grad school, demanding even for the mentally healthy, bore down on me. On the other hand, it gave my days some semblance of structure and social interaction that I sorely needed.</p>
			<p>Doing my work took a humiliating amount of energy. I struggled to keep up and generally couldn't. I asked for extensions, and (thankfully) they were granted. I was convinced that my mental illness had somehow tainted my writing and made it flawed in some way only I couldn’t see. The resulting paralysis in turn made it even harder to do my work. I fell into an endless cycle of anxiety and depression, each feeding on the other.</p>

			<p>As it turns out, academic culture seems more understanding of anxiety than depression. Maybe it’s because stress can be motivating or even healthy in smaller doses. There is no corollary for depression. Maybe it’s because many academics are perfectionists, and anxiety becomes just the price of the writing craft. Or maybe it’s because there’s a sense that if you’re <em>not</em> stressed and overworked, then you're doing grad school wrong. Valorizing overwork makes it fashionable to be anxious in the same way it is fashionable to be busy. By contrast, depression makes people seem lazy, disengaged, unreliable, and incompetent.</p>
			<p>Speaking for myself, anxiety and depression are linked, but there are differences most people miss. Anxious people are preoccupied with outcomes—they want only good things to happen and no bad things. But depressed people believe they don’t deserve good things, and so outcomes are irrelevant. They do little or nothing to ease the clamouring emotional pain. Depression is the ultimate non-starter. Anxious people fear that they will lose everything and everyone they love despite evidence to the contrary. Depressed people suffer from an emotional blind spot—they cannot receive or take in love, even when they know intellectually that it exists.</p>

	<p>The doctor prescribed me antidepressants. I learned that the term “happy pill” is misleading and oversimplified. There is no guarantee that you will respond to medication. There is no way to predict whether you respond or which type of medication you will respond to. Some symptoms might improve while others don’t. The medication takes between two to four weeks before it takes effect. In that period, you may experience side effects. The side effects might fade as your body adjusts to the medication, but there is no way to predict whether they will. The whole process is a frustrating and disappointing game of trial and error.</p>

			<p>The first medication I tried didn't work, although it did make my mouth taste of metal. My doctor tried augmenting it with another medication, but that didn’t take either. In January, for about four weeks, I woke up every day at four in the morning. My doctor and I consulted a psychiatrist, who recommended a different augmenting agent. But again, the combination did not improve my sleep or my mood.</p>
			<p>Too desperate to wait for another appointment, I walked to the hospital emergency room and left with a prescription for a sleeping pill. The sleeping pill also has the pleasant side effect of curbing the depression’s intensity. My jaw unclenches. It feels like the emotional equivalent of a film fading to black. I learn to anticipate this momentary relief when I go to bed, waiting for oblivion.</p>

          	<p>After a four-week trial period with no improvement, my doctor and I decided to stop the first antidepressant and try another one instead. I felt like a fire-breathing dragon: the new antidepressant, Effexor, made my stomach burn after every meal and left an ashy taste in my mouth. The brand names of my medications sounded like Harry Potter spells: Effexor, Ciprolex, Abilify, Remeron, Seroquel. My medication regime changed so frequently that a friend jokes about my new and exciting side effects. </p>
			<p>The Effexor didn't work either. At this point, it was late April, about four months since my diagnosis and about eight months since the initial symptoms. We decided to consult the psychiatrist again. My doctor invited me into her office after talking with the psychiatrist for a few minutes. They both looked grim. The psychiatrist told me she has already booked me in for her earliest available appointment, which is not for another week and a half. She recommended a different antidepressant called nortriptyline.</p>
			<p>But there was a catch: we would have to bring me off the Effexor gradually, wait two weeks for it to completely clear my system, then slowly bring me up on the nortriptyline. She warned me that I may feel worse during the two-week “washout,” when any buffer the Effexor provided will be stripped away. In total, the process would take at least another five weeks before we can expect to see any results.</p>
			<p>“I’m sorry," she said. "I know this wasn’t the answer you were hoping for.”</p>
			<p>My doctors fell silent, watching my expression. One of them handed me a tissue.</p>
			<p class="text-center">* * *</p>
			<p>I asked my psychiatrist about the lack of obvious causes that led to my depression. My parents don't believe in heritable or biological vulnerabilities. She explains that many people conceive of depression in psychosocial terms only, and don't always recognize impact of physiology.</p>
			<p>"What really drives me up the wall," she said, "is when people are willing to accept biological explanations for diabetes, neurological disorders, and so many other chronic illnesses—but they won’t do the same for mental illness.”</p>
			<p>She traces this stigma all the way back to Descartes and the concept of mind-body dualism. It makes us uncomfortable to admit that biochemistry could disrupt or have so much sway over our conscious experience. An illness like depression encroaches on our sense of selves as rational, self-determining individuals. We don't want to believe that willpower isn't always enough. This bias makes us reluctant to ask for help, or makes us believe that it’s somehow more valiant to refuse medication because it is the easy way out.</p>

          	<p>But I also believe that this unwillingness partially emerges from earnest sympathy and pain. People asked me what they could do to help, but I didn’t know the answer to that any more than they did. Being depressed, I easily accepted that that I was relatively helpless, but I suspect that many who knew about my illness didn’t want to do the same. How can you not want to believe there is some way to help, however small, when someone you care about is suffering?</p>
			<p>My psychiatrist continued, “It’s common for people with depression to feel somehow responsible for their illness. It’s not your fault.”</p>
			<p>The guilt in my chest swelled and burst. I don't recall feeling relieved, but I do recall feeling sad. Depression is rarely the direct cause of one person, event, or decision. It confronts us with an ugly truth: people get things they did not want, ask for, or deserve, with little tangible explanation.</p>
			<p class="text-center">* * *</p>
			<p>As the weeks pass, I descended even further, drowning in something without edges. The world I perceived around me was so different from the one inside my head that it felt like a hallucination. I began to disassociate. I drifted from one place to another with no memory of the in-between. I thought about physically hurting myself (but didn't). I was so desperate to feel anything that makes sense.
			<p>But out of some deep-seated impulse to survive—what I thought, at the time, was a kind of biologically-instinctive stupidity—I tried all kinds of things to weather the storm. I sampled various forms of psychological treatment: psychodynamic therapy, mindfulness, group therapy. In the months following, I would also try a bit of nature therapy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy" target="_blank">CBT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy" target="_blank">DBT</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy" target="_blank">ACT</a>. For better or worse, I was and am a diligent and scrupulous person. The same discipline that made me vulnerable to over-commitment and suffering in silence also became a source of quiet determination, and I was determined to get well. I learned something from all of these approaches, although I wouldn’t call any of them a huge success. </p>
			<p>I read a lot, although I was unsure of what exactly I was looking for. I binged on memoirs about mental illness in particular: <em>Darkness Visible</em>, <em>An Unquiet Mind</em>, <em>The Noonday Demon</em>, <em>Marbles</em>, and others. The reading helped. It reminded me that my illness was, to some extent, an external phenomenon and not an ingrained, integral flaw. It also meant that I retained a sense of curiosity—a desire to learn and understand—even when depression had stolen away so many other parts of myself.</p>
			<p>I surrounded myself with pleasant distractions. I folded origami and left or hung them in my suite. I wrote encouraging notes to myself. I made a blanket fort in my living room. A mental health nurse recommends keeping a list of three things, however small, that I appreciate each day. Pleasure was not an indulgence; it was a necessity.</p>

			<p>Depression is a very common illness, but it is simultaneously a very private agony. My depression thrived on loneliness and a sense of disconnection that I couldn't overcome it alone. My friends supported me every chance they could. Difficult times are opportunities for people who care about you to show it and I witnessed the depth of their kindness and generosity.</p>
			<p>In the days I woke repeatedly at four o'clock, I stumbled out of bed and walked to the beach to see the sunrise. Those were some of the most painful and delirious times of my depressive episode. But now that I am better, I can also remember other things. A peaceful, near-perfect silence. The delicate patterns of ice crystals on cars. The glitter of frosted asphalt that made it look as if I was walking on stars—a galaxy of my own.</p>

			<p>In June, the nortriptyline began to work its magic. Some parts of my recovery flipped like a switch. Before, there was a delay between when someone said something and when I understood it. With the nortiptyline, that delay disappeared. I felt sharper and less sluggish. Other parts of the depression, such as my appetite, improved more gradually. More and more, I handled mundane responsibilities such as cleaning or cooking. The first few months were shaky, and my psychiatrist wanted to see more stability before getting too optimistic. By fall, I was well enough to meet her criteria for remission: a return to a pre-depression level of functioning.</p>
			<p>My thoughts are clearer but life is still murky. Given the severity of the depressive episode, my psychiatrist recommends continuing to take the nortriptyline until at least April of next year. Sometimes my mood is still terrible for reasons I can't articulate. Sometimes I am exhausted and don’t know what, exactly, was worth all this trouble. Sometimes I catch myself staring blankly into the middle distance. Sometimes I hold back tears in public places. Sometimes I feel confused and alone and afraid of myself. Sometimes I feel angry at no one and nothing.</p>
			<p>Despite my being in remission, nothing feels resolved. How do I trust my feelings when I know they sometimes play tricks on me? Could the depression have been avoided and, if so, how? Was I vulnerable because I am oversensitive—that I feel and think too deeply—or was it because I was insensitive and inured to the pleasant things in life that would have sustained me?  How does race, gender, age, and other sociological factors play into it? How much of it is my unique circumstance and how much of it can be generalized to others? When I feel terrible, is that remembered pain, present pain, or a warning sign of possible relapse? Did the medication fundamentally alter who I am, or did it restore me to my usual self? If—as I'm constantly told in therapy—I am not my moods or not my thoughts, then what am I and where is “me”? There are no easy answers. There is only what I chose to believe, and I am indecisive.</p>
			<p>Is writing this brave? I don't feel brave. I feel tired so does everyone else.</p>
			<p>I am tired of feeling guilty and anxious about taking breaks. I am tired of feeling too embarrassed to admit that I am taking a break. I am tired of doing too much being rewarded over stepping back and setting boundaries. I am tired of trying so hard to say “Me too” without unintentionally naturalizing a culture of constant overwork and high stress levels. I am tired of feeling guilty for sharing my problems instead of resolving to pay it forward. I am tired of wondering if I am justified in complaining or if everyone else has it worse than me. I am tired of realizing this is a pointless and toxic question. I am tired of feeling instinctive bitterness when I assume that someone isn’t working as hard as me—and then realizing that the bitterness has nothing to do with them and everything to do with my feeling that my labour is unnoticed and underappreciated.</p>
			<p>I am tired of feeling burnt out. I am tired of watching other people burn out. I am grateful for the mostly informal support I receive, but I am tired of knowing that formal support is uneven and lacking. I am tired of realizing that it takes more courage to admit something is wrong than to push on as if it isn’t. Most of all, I am tired of hearing that someone is struggling and feeling unable or unsure of reaching out because maybe that someone doesn't want to talk about it because they are so afraid and everyone is <em>so afraid</em>.</p>
			<p>I am not a spiritual person and academia has taught me to be skeptical. I doubt everything. But, for now, I am willing to entertain the possibility of things changing for the better. I believe that the pain of saying something, no matter how imperfect, hurts less than the pain of saying nothing at all.</p>
